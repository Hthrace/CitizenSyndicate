# Citizen Syndicate

Citizen Syndicate addresses a crucial issue in Star Citizen— the lack of in-game tools to easily locate items. Due to the active development of Star Citizen by Cloud Imperium Games (CIG), current game files no longer contain essential information about item locations, prices, and stats. This absence creates a challenge for players who struggle to find items within the vast Star Citizen universe.

To overcome this obstacle, Citizen Syndicate employs organizational-based crowdsourcing, allowing players to collaboratively contribute and access information about in-game items. The application aims to be a solution for the Star Citizen community, providing a centralized platform for easy sharing and retrieval of crucial details. Its user-friendly design facilitates deployment by player organizations with basic technical skills, ensuring accessibility for a wide range of players.

While the project is actively in development, the ultimate goal is to bridge the information gap caused by the dynamic nature of Star Citizen's development process, providing players with a valuable resource for navigating the game's evolving universe.
